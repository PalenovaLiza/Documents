  <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

<h2>ACT 1</h2>

<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<h4>Two households, both alike in dignity,

<br>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

<br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

<br>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

<br>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

<br>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

<br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows

<br>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.

<br>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

<br>And the continuance of their parents' rage,

<br>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,

<br>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;

<br>The which if you with patient ears attend,

<br>Two households, both alike in dignity,
<br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</h4>

<h2>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h2>

<I><h5>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</h5></I>

<h2>SAMPSONS</h2>

<h4>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</h4>

<h2>GREGORY</h2>

<h4>No, for then we should be colliers.</h4>
