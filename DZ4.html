    <h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>
    <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    <p class="block1">ax + b = 0</p>
    <p>where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes
      called the standard form of a
      linear <br>equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also,
      the variable may or may not be an <span>x</span> <br>so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span>
      there.
    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

    <p class="block">ax^2 + bx + c = 0</p>
    <p>where <span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or
      unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0
    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
    <span>&#960;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span>r</span>) squared:
    <p>A = &#960; &#215; r^2
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span>D</span>):
    <p class="block">A = (&#960;/ 4) &#215; D^2</p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span>C</span>):
    <p class="block">A = C^2 / 4 &#215; &#960;</p>
    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>, denoted by A &#8898;B, is the set of all objects
      that are members of both the
      sets
      <br>A and B. In symbols,
    <p class="block5">A &#8898; B = { x : x &#8948; A and x &#8948; B }</p>
    <p>That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8898; B if and only if <span>x</span> is both an
      element of <span>A</span> and an element of <span>B</span>.
