    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
    <p class="dshjdyznm">
      A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup><a href="#one">[1]</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or
      cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft
      (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and
      spacecraft. <sup><a href="#two">[2]</a></sup>
      <br>
      Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
      wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
      for road
      vehicles types, terms and definitions. <sup><a href="#three">[3]</a></sup>
