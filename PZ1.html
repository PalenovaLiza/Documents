  <h1>Vehicle</h1>
  <p class="dshjdyznm">
  <br>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup><a href="#one">[1]</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,
  <br>bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,
  <br>boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and 
  <br>spacecraft. <sup><a href="#two">[2]</a></sup>
<br>
  <br>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
  <br>wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road
  <br>vehicles types, terms and definitions. <sup><a href="#three">[3]</a></sup>
